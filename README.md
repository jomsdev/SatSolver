# A Simple Sat Solver (SSS)

Given a formula, the **Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT)** is to check whether it is satisfiable or not. In other words, assinging
consistently a value to each variable  (*TRUE* or *FALSE*) in such a way that the formula evaluates to *TRUE*.

**SAT** is one of the first problems that was proven to be **NP-complete** and 
there is no known algorithm that efficiently solves each **SAT** problem. It is generally believed that no such algorithm exists.

Many real world problems can be codified as a **SAT** formula so **Sat solvers** are becoming more and more popular these days.
